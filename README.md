# AR-Application_using_python
BTP_project

Hello all,<br />
This is my BTP project which I did under Prof. Kalyan Sasidhar.

**About this project**<br />
This is a AR application using Python and its famous library OpenCV.<br />

**What makes it work**<br />
    - First of all, you have to make a new folder for this project and download all the given files in this repository into that folder.<br />
    - If you do not have Python on your desktop then download it from google and install it. After that download Python OpenCV, Numpy, and ffpyplayer(for music) from the command prompt using these commands: _pip install opencv-python_, _pip install ffpyplayer_. <br />
    - Now try to run this code but before that make sure that the webcam of your laptop is ON and fully functional.<br />

**Upload your image and video**<br />
    - You can see lines 10, 11, and 60, in those lines we are reading the image and video files. <br />
    - So, if you want to change it with your files, then upload those files into the same folder where you copied this repo and change the path with your image and video path. <br />
    - Image file should be jpg/jpeg/png and the video file should be mp4.<br />
    - I have commented on many code lines but you can uncomment and understand the code.<br />
  
**How to solve errors**<br />
    - First, try to upload an image and video file in its original form but if it is not fitting in the frame then change its aspect ratio to 1:1 ratio.<br />
  
Please refer the BTP_report for a video of this project.<br />
